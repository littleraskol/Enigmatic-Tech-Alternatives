 tech_enigmatic_power_core:0 "Enigmatic Power Generation"
 tech_enigmatic_power_core_desc:0 "These generators cause particles to interact with each other in ways that seem to defy nature. Somehow they can put out more power than what would seem possible."
 tech_enigmatic_deflector:0 "Enigmatic Deflectors"
 tech_enigmatic_deflector_desc:0 "These deflectors operate in ways that seem to defy the laws of nature. Somehow they can manage to muster a protective field many times greater than what could seem possible."
 tech_enigmatic_disruption_field:0 "Enigmatic Disruption Field"
 tech_enigmatic_disruption_field_desc:1 "By flooding a localized area with weak, randomly-modulated electromagnetic pulses, enemy shield and weapons systems can be partially disrupted."
 tech_enigmatic_encoder:0 "Enigmatic Encoder"
 tech_enigmatic_encoder_desc:1 "The Enigmatic Encoder scrambles flight path data according to some indeterminable design before feeding it back to fleet command."
 tech_enigmatic_decoder:0 "Enigmatic Decoder"
 tech_enigmatic_decoder_desc:1 "While producing average results in standard tests, the accuracy of Enigmatic Decoder's prediction algorithms seemingly increases as the target's flight path grows more erratic."
